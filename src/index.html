      <h3>What I've done, am doing and want to continue</h3>
      <p>I am in the process of reinventing myself.</p>
      <p>I worked in the "wilderness therapy" industry for 20 years, after college and grad school.  And a bit of world travel.</p>
      <p>During my first career, I gravitated into the IT Support aspects of the business, as I found computers helpful, rather than intimidating.  I ran the company's website, and managed the database, and email server and helped direct weekly webinars.  I did lots of on-the-job learning.
      <p> Now, I'm seriously invested in learning to code.  </p>

      <h3>My skills</h3>
      <p>I can copy edit well.  My mother was an English teacher and I inherited a near superhuman ability to immediately spot misspellings or poor grammar.  I grew up before emoticons and hashtags morphed the written language.</p>
